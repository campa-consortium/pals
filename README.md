# Particle Accelerator Lattice Standard (PALS)

An effort to create a standard to promote lattice information exchange for particle accelerators.
PALS can also serve as the schema for new simulation programs and 
the associated code that comes
with PALS will be usable to read/validate/write lattice files thus saving considerable programming time.

## Scope

PALS is a standard for describing particle accelerator lattices, with focus on
the physical layout and properties of a machine.
The tracking of particles is not part of PALS, although some tracking related parameters that
can be useful to share will be described by the standard.

## Participation

Community involvement is invited! 
There are weekly (more or less) meetings to discuss development of the lattice standard.
To participate in the creation of the lattice standard, 
please contact [Jean-Luc Vay](https://github.com/jlvay) to be put on the mailing list. 

## Goals

1. **Community outreach:** Through papers, talks and other avenues, inform the accelerator community
about PALS. Additionally, seek involvement from the community.

2. **Develop the PALS standard.** 

3. **[Develop Libraries and tools to read/write/visualize/manipulate PALS lattices.](https://pals-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lattice.html)**

4. **Develop translators between PALS and other simulation formats.**

5. **Document how various accelerator modeling codes parameterize lattices.**
