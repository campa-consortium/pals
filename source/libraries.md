PALS can also be implemented in-memory in programming languages.


## Python

The [PALS-Python](https://github.com/campa-consortium/pals-python) project implements the PALS schema in a file-agnostic way, mirrored in data objects.

PALS-Python provides interfaces to:
* define lattices,
* expand & evaluate expressions on lattices,
* write and read from/to files,
* convert files and
* validate existing files.


## More Implementations Wanted!

We welcome community implementations of PALS!
We seek implementations such as readers of PALS-conforming files to Julia/C++/Fortran/etc., visualization of PALS files, and more!
