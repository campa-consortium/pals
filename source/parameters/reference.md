## ReferenceP: Reference Parameters

The `ReferenceP` parameter group contains parameters for describing the reference energy,
species, and time. 
The components of this group and their defaults are:
```{code} yaml
refp1:              # [string] user-defined name
  kind: ReferenceP
  species_ref: ""   # [string] Reference species
  pc_ref: 0         # [momentum*c] Reference momentum times speed of light
  E_tot_ref: 0      # [eV] Reference total energy
  time_ref: 0       # [s] Reference time
  location: ""      # [string] Where reference parameters are evaluated
```

The `location` component records where the reference parameters are evaluated at.
Possible values are
```{code} yaml
  location: UPSTREAM_END    # Upstream end of the element
and
```{code} yaml
  location: DOWNSTREAM_END  # Downstream end of the element
```
Except for `time_ref`, the reference parameters are generally the same at the
upstream and downstream ends of the element. However, there are exceptions.
For example, the upstream and downstream `species_ref` for a `Foil` element 
will generally be different. And the reference energy will change if the
`dE_ref` component of the [`ReferenceChangeP`](#s.ref.change.params) group is nonzero.
See the [`ReferenceChangeP`](#s.ref.change.params) for details as how the reference
energy and time is computed.

For a `BeginningEle` element, parameters of this group are user settable.
For all other element kinds, the parameters of this
group are calculated by  and are not user settable.
