## ApertureP: Aperture Parameters

The `ApertureP` parameter group contains parameters for describing an aperture. 
The components of this group and their defaults are:
```{code} yaml
ApertureP:
  x_limits: [NaN, NaN]             # [m] Vector of two real numbers
  y_limits: [NaN, NaN]             # [m] Vector of two real numbers
  shape: ""                        # [string] Aperture shape switch
  location: ENTRANCE_END           # [enum] Aperture location switch
  vertices: []                     # [array] Array of vertex points. See below.
  material: ""                     # [string] Material of the Aperture
  thickness: 0                     # [m] Real number
  aperture_shifts_with_body: false # [Boolean] See below.
  aperture_active: true            # [Boolean] false implies aperture is not operating.
```

### Location component

The aperture location is set by the `location` parameter. Possible values are
```{code} yaml
  location: ENTRANCE_END   # Body entrance end (default)
  location: CENTER         # Element center
  location: EXIT_END       # Body exit end
  location: BOTH_ENDS      # Both ends
  location: NOWHERE        # No location
  location: EVERYWHERE     # Everywhere
```
The default is `ENTRANCE_END`.

### Shape component

```{figure} figures/apertures.svg
:width: 90%
:name: f:aperture

A) RECTANGULAR and ELLIPTICAL apertures. As drawn, `x_limit[1]` and `y_limit[1]` are 
negative and `x_limit[2]` and `y_limit[2]` are positive. B) The `vertices` aperture is defined
by a set of vertices.
```

The `shape` parameter selects the shape of the aperture. Possible values are:
```{code} yaml
  shape: RECTANGULAR   # Rectangular shape.
  shape: ELLIPTICAL    # Elliptical shape.
  shape: VERTICES      # Shape defined by set of vertices.
  shape: CUSTOM_SHAPE  # Shape defined outside of the lattice standard.
```

### x_limits and y_limits components

For `RECTANGULAR` and `ELLIPTICAL` shapes the `x_limits` and `y_limits` parameters are
used to calculate the aperture as shown in {numref}`f:aperture`A. 

For an `ELLIPTICAL` aperture, all four limits must be set otherwise the aperture is not active.
A particle with position {math}`(x, y)` is outside of the aperture if:
```{code}
  ((x - x0) / xw)^2 + ((y - y0) / yw)^2 > 1 
where
  x0 = (x_limits[2] - x_limits[1]) / 2
  y0 = (y_limits[2] - y_limits[1]) / 2
  xw = (x_limits[2] - x_limits[1]) / 2
  yw = (y_limits[2] + y_limits[1]) / 2
```

For a `RECTANGULAR` aperture, a particle is outside of the aperture if any of the following
four conditions is true:
```{code}
  1) x < x_limits[1] && x_limits[1] != NaN
  2) x > x_limits[2] && x_limits[2] != NaN
  3) y < y_limits[1] && y_limits[1] != NaN
  4) y > y_limits[2] && y_limits[2] != NaN
```

### aperture_shifts_with_body

The `aperture_shifts_with_body` parameter determines whether misaligning an element 
affects the placement of the aperture. The default is `False`. 
A common case where `aperture_shifts_with_body` would be `False` is when a beam pipe,
which incorporates the aperture, is not physically touching the surrounding magnet element. 
When tracking a particle, assuming that there are only apertures at the element ends, 
the order of computation with `aperture_shifts_with_body` set to `False` could be
```{code} yaml
  1) Start at upstream end of element
  2) Check upstream aperture if there is one.
  3) Convert from branch coordinates to body coordinates.
  4) Track through the element body.
  5) Convert from body coordinates to branch coordinates.
  6) Check downstream aperture if there is one.
  7) End at downstream end of element.
```
With `aperture_shifts_with_body` set to `true`, the computation order could be
```{code} YAML
  1) Start at upstream end of element
  2) Convert from branch coordinates to body coordinates.
  3) Check upstream aperture if there is one.
  4) Track through the element body.
  5) Check downstream aperture if there is one.
  6) Convert from body coordinates to branch coordinates.
  7) End at downstream end of element.
```
The difference between the two lists is simply that lines 2 and 3 are switched along with lines
5 and 6.

### material

The `material` parameter sets the material of the aperture. 
Using chemical formulas like `Cu` and `Fe` is the most portable.

### vertices component

The `VERTICES` setting for `shape` is for defining an aperture using a 
set of vertex points as illustrated in {numref}`f:aperture`B. 
Between vertex points, the aperture can follow a straight line or the arc of an ellipse. 
The vertex points are specified by setting the `vertices` parameter. This parameter has three
subcomponents
```{code} yaml
  verticies:
    center: 0                 # [m] Vector of (x, y) center point.
    absolute_vertices: false  # [Boolean] Default is False.
    list: [{}]                # [List of dictionaries] Ordered list of vertex points.
```
The `list` vector can have the components:
```{code} yaml
point       # [m] Vector of two real numbers.
radius      # [m] Vector of single or two real numbers.
tilt        # [rad/2pi] Ellipse tilt angle.
```
Example:
```{code} yaml
ApertureP:
  vertices:
    center: [-0.045, 0.011]
    absolute_vertices: true
    list:
      - point: [0.023, 0.069]      # V1
      - point: [-0.025, 0.067]     # V2
      - radius: [0.08, 0.04]
      - tilt: 0.12
      - point: [-0.088, 0.036]     # V3
      - point: [-0.088, -0.021]    # V4
      - point: [0.023, -0.033]     # V5
```
This corresponds roughly to what is shown in {numref}`f:aperture`.

If the boolean `absolute_vertices` is set `False`, which is the default,
the vertex point positions are with respect to the `center` point. 
That is, the vertex point positions in absolute terms are the positions given with each vertex plus
the position of the `center`. If `absolute_vertices` is `true`, the vertex point positions 
are independent of the `center` point. The default position of the `center` is the origin.

The `list` component of `vertices` contains an ordered  list of vertex 
`point`s with each one specifying an {math}`(x, y)` position. 
In between any two `point`s, there can optionally be a single `radius` element.
If there is a `radius` element, there can also be a  single `tilt` element between
the `point`s but `tilt` can only be present if there is a `radius` present.
There can also be a `radius` element and `tilt` element after the last `point` in the `list`. 
If these are present, they are considered to be between the last and first `point`s in the list.

The aperture is constructed by connecting consecutive `point`s in the `list` along with
connecting the last `point` to the first. If there is no `radius` between consecutive `point`s,
the aperture follows a straight line between the points. If there is a `radius` element between
two points, the aperture is either a circular arc or a section of an ellipse. 
A `radius` can have either a single value or a list of two values. If a `radius` has a single
value, this is the radius of the circular arc connecting the vertices. In this case, the `tilt`
element may not be present. If the `radius` has two values, these are the half lengths of the 
principal diameters. If the `tilt` is zero (the default), the ellipse is upright with the first 
`radius` value being the {math}`x`-axis half width and the second value being the {math}`y`-axis
half width. A non-zero `tilt` value rotates the ellipse by that amount. 

In order to be able to quickly calculate whether a particle is inside or outside the
aperture, the aperture shape has some restrictions. For one, 
the vertex points must be arranged so that the polar coordinate angle of the vertex points
with respect to the `center` point is increasing. That is, for vertices {math}`v_i` and
{math}`v_{i+1}` that are at angles {math}`\theta_i` and {math}`\theta_{i+1}` with respect
to the `center` point:
```{math}
  0 < \theta_{i+1} - \theta_{i} \pmod{2\pi} < \pi
```
Another restriction is that any half-line drawn from the `center` point out to infinity intersects
the aperture at exactly one point. Finally, for a circular or elliptical arc, of
the four possible solutions that connect the two vertex points at the ends of the arc, 
the arc used is the arc of minimal length such that the center of the ellipse is on the same side
as the `center` point with respect to a line drawn through the two points.

When using vertices, an efficient way to determine if a point {math}`(x, y)` is within the aperture
is the following. Note: The computation is with respect to the `center` point.
```{code} yaml
  0) Determine the polar coordinate angles {math}`\theta_i` of the vertices. These angles can be 
stored so this computation only has to be done once.
  1) Determine the angle of the particle.
  2) A simple binary search will give the neighboring pair of vertices the particle's angle falls between.
  3) A simple geometric calculation now determines where the half line drawn from the `center`
and through the particle point intersects the aperture.
  4) The particle is outside the aperture if and only if the intersection point is between the 
particle point and the `center` point.
