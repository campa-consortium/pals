(s:beamline.components)=
## BeamLine components

A lattice [`branch`](#s:branches) is constructed from a `BeamLine`. A BeamLine is essentially 
an ordered array of elements. 
Each element of a `BeamLine` is either a lattice element or another `BeamLine`. 
A BeamLine that is contained within another BeamLine is called a `subline`
of the containing BeamLine.
The top level `BeamLine` from which a branch is constructed is called a `root Beamline`. 

The components of a BeamLine are:
```{code} yaml
name        # Optional. String: Name of the BeamLine.
multipass   # Optional. Bool: Multipass line or not. Default is False.
length      # Optional. [m]: Length of the BeamLine.
line        # Ordered list: List of elements.
zero_point  # Optional. String: Name of a line item used as a reference point when
            #  the BeamLine is used as a subline.
periodic    # Optional Bool. Are orbit and Twiss parameters periodic? Default is False.
```

The `name` component is a string that can be used to reference the `BeamLine`.

The optional `mutipass` component is a boolean describing whether the `BeamLine` is part of 
a [multipass construct](#c:multipass). The default is False.

The optional `length` component gives the length of the `BeamLine`. 
If `length` is not given, the BeamLine ends at the downstream end of the final
element in the `line` and with this the length of the BeamLine can be calculated.

The optional `zero_point` component is used to position sublines.
The value of `zero_point` is the name of a line element that marks the reference point. 
To make things unambiguous, the reference line element must have zero length.

Setting optional `periodic` Boolean to `True` indicates that the `BeamLine` is something like a 
storage ring where the particle beam recirculates through the `BeamLine` multiple times.
Setting `periodic` to `False` is used to indicate that the `BeamLine` is something like a 
Linac or any other line that is "single pass". 

Notice that a setting `periodic` to `True` does **not** mean that the downstream end of
the last element of the `BeamLine` has the same [floor](#s:floor) coordinates as the floor
coordinates at the beginning. Setting `periodic` to `True` simply signals to a program that
it may be appropriate to calculate periodic orbits and Twiss parameters
as opposed to calculating orbits and Twiss
parameters based upon orbit and Twiss parameters set by the User for the beginning of the `BeamLine`.  
Indeed, it is sometimes convenient to treat `BeamLines` as periodic even though there is no 
closure in the floor coordinate sense.
For example, when a storage ring has a number of repeating "periods", it may be
convenient, for speed reasons, to calculate the periodic functions using only use one period.

The default value of `False` for a given `BeamLine` is not affected by any 
setting of `periodic` in any subline of the `Beamline`. When constructing lattice `branches`,
the setting of `periodic` in a [root](#s:lattice.construct) `BeamLine` can be overridden
by setting the `periodic` component of the `branch`. See [](#s:lattice.construct) for
details.

The `line` component of a BeamLine holds an ordered list of `items`. 
Each item represents one (or more if there is a `repeat` count) lattice element or
BeamLine. 

A line item can have components
```{code} yaml
repeat          # Integer. Repetition count. Default is 1.
direction       # +1 or -1. Longitudinal orientation of element. Default is +1.
placement       # Structure. Shifts element or subline longitudinally.
inherit         # Name of lattice element or subline defined outside the line
name            # Name of lattice element or subline.
type            # Type of element.
```

Example with four items in `line`:
```{code} yaml
Sextupole:
  name: thingB

BeamLine:
  name: inj_line
  multipass: True
  length: 37.8
  zero_point: thingC
  line:
    - thingB                # This item refers to the name of an element or BeamLine defined elsewhere.
    - thingZ:               # thingZ inherits parameters from thingB
        inherit: thingB    
    - Q1a:                  # Define an element in place called Q1a
        type: Quadrupole 
        length: 1.03
        direction: -1
        ...
    - a_subline:            # Item a_subline is repeated three times
        repeat: 3
        ...
```

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(s:line.construction)=
## Constructing a BeamLine `line` 

A line item that is a lattice element can be specified by name if a lattice element
of that name has been defined. Example:
```{code} yaml
Quadrupole: 
  name: q1w
  ...

BeamLine:
  line:
    - q1w               # Line item is element q1w.
    - q1w_01:           # q1w_01 interits parameters from q1
      inherit: q1
      BodyShiftP:       #   and the parameters for q1w_01 can be modified...
        ...
    ...
```

A line item which is a lattice element can also be specified by defining the lattice element
"in place" in the line. Example:
```{code} yaml
BeamLine:
  name: a_line
  line:
    - octA:              # This is a new element not previously defined.
        type: Octupole    
        Kn3L: 0.34
        ...
    ...
```

A line item may be a subline:
```{code} yaml
BeamLine:
  name: linac_line
  line:
    ...

BeamLine:
  name: main_line
  line:
    - linac_line:          # linac_line is used as a subline
        direction: -1      #  parameters like reflection, etc can be used.
```

Restriction: Infinite recursion of sublines is not allowed. 
For example, if BeamLine `B` is a subline of `A`, then BeamLine `A` may not be a subline of `B`.
Also sublines must be defined externally and not in place.

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(s:repetition)=
## Repetition

For any line item, a `repeat` count component can be used to represent multiple copies
of the item. Example:
```{code} yaml
BeamLine:
  name: full_line
  line:
    - short_line:
        repeat: 3
```
In this case, `short_line` is repeated three times when the BeamLine is expanded to form a lattice
branch. For example, if `short_line` is a beamline defined by:
```{code} yaml
BeamLine:
  name: short_line
  line:
    - A
    - B
    - C
```
then the expanded `full_line` will look like:
```{code} yaml
A, B, C, A, B, C, A, B, C
```

repetition counts can be negative. In this case, the elements are taken to occur in reverse order.
Thus, in the above example, if the `repeat` count was `-3`, the expanded `full_line` will
look like:
```{code} yaml
C, B, A, C, B, A, C, B, A
```

Notice that reverse order does not mean true [direction reversal](#s:ref.construct). 
For elements that have longitudinal symmetry, this does not matter. 
However, for example, for a `Bend` element that is in a line with reversed order,
the edge angle `e1` will still represent the edge of the upstream side and `e2` will represent the edge 
at the downstream side.

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(s:direction)=
## Direction reversal

The optional `direction` component of an item can be used for true [direction reversal](#s:ref.construct).
Possible values are `+1` and `-1`. The Default is `+1` which represents an unreversed element
or BeamLine. BeamLine reversal involves both reversed order of the line and direction reversal of
the individual line items. Example:
```{code} yaml
BeamLine:
  name: lineA
  line:
    - lineB:
        direction: -1
    ...

BeamLine:
  name: lineB
  line:
    - ele1
    - ele2:
        direction: -1
```
The expanded `lineA` has elements:
```{code} yaml
ele2, -ele1
```
where the negative sign here indicates that `ele1` is reversed in direction. 
Notice that `ele2` is not reversed since the reversal of a reversed element results
in an element that is unreversed.

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(s:placement)=
## Line item placement

```{figure} figures/superimpose.svg
:width: 80%
:name: f:superposition

Positioning of a line item (which may be a lattice element or BeamLine) with respect to 
a "base" line item when there is an explicit placement component present. Assuming
unreversed elements, a positive offset positions the item being positioned downstream
of the `base_item`. The figure is drawn with the `from_point` and `to_point` having their
default values of `EXIT_END` and `ENTRANCE_END` respectively and assuming that the line
items are not reversed in orientation.
```

By default,
a line item is placed such that the entrance end of the item is aligned with the exit end
of the preceding item as explained in the [Branch Coordinates Construction](#s:ref.construct) section.
To adjust the longitudinal placement of an item, 
the `placement` component of an item can be used.
When there is a `placement` component, figure {numref}`f:superposition` shows how the line item 
is positioned with respect to a `"base"` line item. 

The components of `placement` are:
```{code} yaml
offset       # Optional Real [m]. Longitudinal offset of the line item. Default is zero.
to_point     # Optional switch. Line item offset end point. Default is ENTRANCE_END.
base_item    # Optional string. Line item containing the `from_point`.  
from_point   # Optional switch. Base line item offset beginning point. Default is EXIT_END.
```
If the `base_item` is not specified, the default is the previous element or the beginning 
of the `line` if there is no previous element.

The `from_point` is the reference point on the base line item and `to_point` is the
reference point on the element being positioned. The distance between these points is set by 
the value of `offset`.
The values of `from_point` and `to_point` can be one of the following:
```{code} yaml
ENTRANCE_END       # Entrance end of the item. Default for the `to_point` component.
CENTER             # Center of the item.
EXIT_END           # Exit end of the item. Default for the `from_point` component.
ZERO_POINT         # Used with sublines that define a `zero_point`.
```

Example:
```{code} yaml
BeamLine:
  name: position_line
  line:
    - thingA
    - extract_line:
        placement:
          offset: 37.5
          base_item: thingA
          from_point: EXIT_END
          to_point: ZERO_POINT

BeamLine:
  name: extract_subline
  line:
      ...
```
In this example, the `to_point` is the `zero_point` of `extract_subline`.
The `from_point` of `thingA` is placed `37.5` meters from the `to_point` point with
the `to_point` being at the exit end of `thingA`.

The value of `offset` may be negative as well as positive. With negative offsets, 
the [lattice expansion](#s:expansion) calculation may become recursive but, in any case, plancement
must be computable. That is, situations where there in infinite recursion is forbidden.

In a section of a line where the lattice elements are not reversed, a positive `offset` moves
the element being placed downstream. If there is reversal, a positive `offset` moves
the element being placed upstream. That is, placement will not affect the relative distances
of items if a line is reversed. In the above example, if `this_line` expandeds to:
```{code} yaml
thingA, thingB, thingC
```
then the following 
```{code} yaml
BeamLine:
  line:
    - this_line:
        repeat: -1
```
Would expand to
```{code} yaml
thingC, thingB, thingA
```
with the same relative distances between elements. Similarly, this:
```{code} yaml
BeamLine:
  line:
    - position_line:
        direction: -1
```
Would expand to
```{code} yaml
-thingC, -thingB, -thingA
```
again with the same relative distances between elements.

Lattice elements are allowed to overlap but it should be kept in mind that 
some programs will not be able to handle overlapping fields. 
To remove an ambiguity, if two zero length elements are next to each other in a `line`, the order of the
elements determines the order in which they should tracked through. For example,
if a line contains the two zero length elements:
```{code} yaml
BeamLine:
  line:
    - markerA
    - markerB
```
then the order of tracking will be `markerA` followed by `markerB`.

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(s:superposition)=
## Superposition

The superposition construct is used to add elements to a beamline after the beamline has been defined.
Superposition does not change the length of the beamline.

A superposition specifies an element to place on the beamline and a [`placement`](#s:placement) construct
to position the element within the beamline. Example:
```{code} yaml
BeamLine:
  name: this_line
  line:
    ...
    - markerA
    ...

superimpose:
  place: q10w
  placement:
    base_item: markerA
    ...
```
In this example, the superposition places an element named `q10w` with respect to the
element `markerA`. This superposition will apply to any `markerA` elements that exist in
any beamline. To restrict where the superposition is applied, the appropriate 
[qualified name](#s:name.matching). For example:
```{code} yaml
superimpose:
  place: q10w
  placement:
    base_item: this_line>>markerA
    ...
```
With this example, superposition would be restricted to `markerA` elements that exist in
the beamline `this_line`.

Superposition can be used to position elements to physically overlap other elements.
A common use case is to superimpose a `Marker` element in the middle of another element.
Note: superposition shares the feature of describing elements that overlap physically, 
together with the [`UnionEle`](#s:unionele) type element and the use of the
[`placement`](#s:placement) construct in a BeamLine.
