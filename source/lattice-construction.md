## Constructing a Lattice

A `Lattice` contains a set of branches. 
Each branch is instantiated from a `BeamLine` that is called the `root BeamLine`.
Example:
```{code} yaml
- Lattice:
    - branches:
        - this_line    # this_line is the root beamline for the branch.
        - that_line:
            inherit: that_ring    # Inherit from that_ring BeamLine
            periodic: True
```
In this example, `this_line` and `that_line` are the names of the root BeamLines
for the two `Branches` that will be created when the lattice is [expanded](#s:expansion).
Branches created due to `Fork` elements also have root `BeamLines`. `Branches` specified
in the `Lattice` structure are called `root branches` of the `lattice`. Non-root branches
are those branches created due to `Fork` elements.

A branch has the optional components
```{code} yaml
inherit   # Optional String. Name of the root BeamLine for the branch. Default is the name of the Branch.
periodic  # Optional Bool. Are orbit and Twiss parameters periodic? 
          #   Default is the setting of the root BeamLine.
```
The setting of `periodic` for a `Branch` overrides the setting of `periodic`
set in the root `BeamLine`. See [](#s:beamline.components) for documentation of `periodic`.

(s:branch.expand)=
## Branch Expansion

`Branch expansion` is the process, starting from the `root BeamLine`
of a branch, of constructing the ordered list of lattice elements contained in that branch.

The first lattice element of any root `BeamLine` line must be a `Beginning` element and the expanded
branch line may only contain this one `Beginning` element. If a subline contains a `Beginning`
element, this element must be dropped from the branch line.

The last lattice element of a branch line must be a `Marker` element.

Notes:
- When a lattice is expanded, 
in any region of a `Branch` where the elements are not directionally reversed, the elements
must be ordered such that the longitudinal positions at the upstream end of the elements is ordered
in increasing {math}`s`-position value. For a region where the elements are directionally
reversed, the downstream end of the elements must be ordered in increasing {math}`s`-position.
This mandate on element ordering ensures that the order of elements in a directionally reversed
`BeamLine` is always the reverse of the order of elements in the non-reversed `BeamLine`.

(s:lattice.expand)=
## Lattice Expansion

`Lattice expansion` is the process, starting from a `Lattice` structure instance, where:
- The `root BeamLines` of the branches are expanded.
- `Fork` elements contained in the root branches are used to construct new branches and, 
 if these new branches have `Fork` elements, 
this process is repeated until no new branches need to be created.
- The floor position along with the reference energy, species and time, of the lattice elements, is computed.
- Mathematical expressions are evaluated.

Notes:
- All branches must have unique names. However, different branches may use the same root `BeamLine`.
- As detailed in [](#s:forking), some `Fork` elements may connect to an existing branch.
These `Fork` elements will not trigger new branch creation. 
- The PALS standard does not mandate how branches should be stored in memory after expansion.
For example, branches could be stored using an array or a tree. 
In any case, the root branches must be marked as such.
- The order in which new branches are added to the lattice due to the presence of `Fork` elements 
is not mandated by PALS. This can lead to the situation where connecting a `Fork` element to 
what is designated as an existing branch is not possible since the branch being forked to 
does not yet exist since
the `Fork` element that instantiates this branch has not been processed yet. In this case,
the first `Fork` element must be temporarily ignored until the branch is instantiated.

(s:forking)=
## Forking

A `Fork` element marks a point in a lattice branch where another branch is attached to. 
A common example is using a `Fork` element to connect from a storage ring to 
an extraction line or an X-ray beam line. Similarly, a `Fork` can be used to connect 
from the end of an injection line to someplace in a ring. 
An example of how forking can be used to construct complex machine layouts
is shown in figure {numref}`f:fork`. 

```{figure} figures/fork.svg
:width: 80%
:name: f:fork

Example of how `Fork` and `Patch` elements can be used to describe even complicated machine geometries.
In the upper right hand corner is shown the Cornell/Brookhaven CBETA machine.
This machine includes an Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) with
8-pass (4 passes with increasing energy and 4 passes with decreasing energy) along with
an injection line, a diagnostic line, and a beam stop line.
The ERL part of the machine includes the Linac, a Fixed Focusing Alternating 
Gradient (FFAG) arc, and splitter sections.

Shown in the main body of the figure is a blowup of the region where the injection line connects 
to the Linac along with the diagnostic line and the end of the FFAG arc.
The injection line and the ERL was modeled as a single lattice branch which contained all 8 passes.
`Fork` elements were used to connect the injection line to the diagnostic line and ERL to the 
beam stop line.
The geometry of the splitter sections, used to correct the timings of the beams with 
differing energies, is done using `Patch` elements.
```

The `branch` containing a forking element is called the
"`from-branch`". The `branch` that the forking element points to is called the
"`to-branch`". It is possible for these two branches to be one and the same.
The element in the to-branch that the `Fork` connects to is called the "`to-element`".

`Fork` elements are uni-directional. That is, particles can travel from a `Fork` element
in a `from-branch` to the `to-branch` of the `Fork` but travel cannot happen in
the reverse direction. To get a bi-directional link between branches, use two `Forks` with
the `to-element` of both `Forks` being the other `Fork`.

To avoid ambiguities, the kinds of `to-elements` are restricted to be one of:
- Marker
- Beginning
- FloorPosition
- Fork

Notice that these kinds of elements have zero length and unit transfer maps.

A `Fork` element has zero length and must always have a [`ForkP`](#fork.params) parameter group.
The components of the `ForkP` group are:
```{code} yaml
  to_beamline           # String: Name of BeamLine to fork to.
  to_branch             # String: Name of Branch to fork to.
  to_element            # Optional String: Element to fork to. Default is Beginning.
  direction             # Optional Switch: Longitudinal Direction of travel of injected beam.
  branch_name           # Optional String: Name to give created Branch.
  propagate_reference   # Optional Boolian: Propagate reference species and energy? Default is False.
```
The possible values of the optional `direction` switch are:
```{code} yaml
FORWARDS            # Injected particle propagates in forward (+s) direction. Default.
BACKWARDS           # Injected particle propagates in reverse (-s) direction.
```

The `direction` component of `ForkP` indicates the direction that a particle moving into
the forked-to branch will travel. If `direction` is set to `FORWARDS` (the default)
the direction of travel is downstream (`+s`-direction) and vice versa if `direction` is set to
`BACKWARDS`. Note: It does not make sense to have `direction` set to `BACKWARDS` if the
`to-element` is the `Beginning` element. Similarly, it does not make sense to have `direction`
set to `FORWARDS` if the `to-element` is the end element in the branch.

The `ForkP` group of any given `Fork` element must contain one and only one of `to_beamline`
or `to_branch`. If `to_beamline` is present, a new branch is to be created and added to
the `Lattice` set of branches. In this case, `branch_name` may be set giving the name
of the branch. If `to_branch` is present, the fork connects to an existing branch. In this case,
`branch_name` is ignored.

The optional `to_element` component of `ForkP` gives the name of the `to-element`. 
If not present, the default is the `Beginning` element.
The names given by `to_element` must be unique.
The `to-element` may inherit the reference species and energy of the `Fork` element 
if and only if the `to-element` is the `Beginning` element and
the `propagate_reference` component is set to `True` (the default is `False`).
Reference propagation override any reference setting in the `to-element`.

Example `Fork` element:
```{code} yaml
  Fork:
    name: to_dump
    ForkP:
      to_beamline: generic_dump
      to_element: dump_beginning
      branch_name: this_dump
      propagate_reference: True
```
In this example, a `Fork` element connects to a new branch which will be instantiated using
a `BeamLine` called `generic_dump`. In the expanded lattice, the branch will be called
`this_dump`. The reference properties at the `dump_beginning`, element that is forked to,
assuming this is the `BeginningEle` element at the beginning of the branch., will inherit
the reference properties at the `Fork` element.
